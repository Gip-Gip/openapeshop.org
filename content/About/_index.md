### Open Ape Shop is a small ({{< pcnt >}} man) non-profit organisation with the goal of developing quality and completely open-source hardware and software.

Primarily just a group of people working on open source projects in free time, members of Open Ape Shop pride ourself in our ability to problem solve and work on projects as if they're pieces of art being sculpted and perfected by old craftsmen.
Diverse in ability, we mostly concern ourselves with everyday utilities and rocketry, and we enjoy being flexible and willing to learn new things.
We use only the most ideal tools for the job, so most of our programming is done completely in Rust and we use completely open source cad software and cad formats for our designs.
